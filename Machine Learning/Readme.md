COMPASS is One of the widely used criminal risk assessment tool (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions). 
It has been used to assess more than 1 million offenders since it was developed. This software predicts a defendant’s risk of committing 
a misdemeanor or felony within 2 years of assessment from 137 features about an individual and the individual’s past criminal record.

Analyzed the COMPAS recidivism data using Python and identified the best features and machine learning model to predict recidivism. 
Classification models Used: 
            * Probabilistic model: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes
            * Linear Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
            * Decision Model: Random Forest
            * Non-Linear Model: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
