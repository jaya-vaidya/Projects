‘ReTHINK, ReFEED’ is a web-based ‘marketplace’ that will connect the organizations and people who have excess food with nonprofits, NGOs, charities and others who need good quality food. The Food Donors such as restaurants, cafeterias, supermarkets, farms, etc. will be able to sign up with their details including their location. Aid group organizations like charities, food shelters and other nonprofits that have been carefully vetted for authenticity will also sign up with their details such as location and food preferences. Whenever the Donors have excess food, they can post the details online and the system will send alerts to all the charities and nonprofits in the system based on their location and food preferences. These charities will then be able to book the food. Once the match is made, the food rescue volunteers who work with the organization will recover the surplus food and deliver it to the charities in need.  The organization will also accept financial donations to fund the various activities.
