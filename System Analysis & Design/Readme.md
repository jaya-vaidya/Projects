‘ReTHINK, ReFEED’ provides a web-based marketplace and acts a platform to connect the food service industry (which has excess food) and the qualified charities that work with the needy. 

Donors (Farms, restaurants, cafeterias, hotels and grocery stores) post excess food on the website. Aid group organizations (soup kitchens, food pantries, and charities) who have already been vetted for authenticity, can see what is available locally and complete a transaction online to secure food. The food access is based on the location. This application provides an efficient and effortless way for both the Donors and the Charities to identify each other with just one click!
